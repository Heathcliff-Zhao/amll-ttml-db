[00:15.242] I don't feel safe in this bed
[00:19.634] There are voices in my head
[00:23.840] I've been talking to the dead
[00:27.649] And the fear baptized me
[00:32.304] My kingdom turned to dust
[00:35.678] And I watched all my riches rust
[00:39.773] Have I lost the midus touch
[00:43.899] Or do sad eyes blind me
[00:48.583] Over and over we go
[00:51.661] Over the hills and the valleys below
[00:55.578] Oh and it follows me follows me home
[00:59.932] And it suffocates me
[01:08.422] Oh, I can't breathe
[01:12.035] I said oh, I can't breath
[01:16.023] All I know
[01:22.688] Is I forgot how to be me
[01:39.700] I don't feel safe in these halls
[01:44.022] There are bruises on the walls
[01:47.952] There are bodies in the floors
[01:52.064] And they breathe so loudly
[01:56.635] I wish I could move
[01:59.880] Get up and walk right out this tomb
[02:04.097] Do our saviors die too soon?
[02:08.428] For my sins surround me
[02:12.901] Over and over we go
[02:16.168] Over the hills and valleys below
[02:20.047] Oh and it follows me follows me home
[02:24.318] And it suffocates me
[02:32.808] Oh, I can't breathe
[02:36.421] I said oh, I can't breathe
[02:40.320] All I know, woah, oh oh ooh
[02:46.746] Is I forgot how to be me
[02:50.433] Hallelujah
[02:54.768] Where is my god?
[02:56.562] Where are you?
[02:58.549] Hallelujah
[03:03.276] Nothing is pulling me through
[03:06.338] Hallelujah
[03:10.343] When I don't know how to be
[03:14.392] Hallelujah
[03:19.126] I forgot how to be me
[03:25.367] When he gave up the fight
[03:29.103] A quick decision lay in the night
[03:33.804] Which stayed with me for all of my life
[03:38.268] I miss you so
